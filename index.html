    <p class="left">FriRide is a hitchhiking app for the modern world, giving you access to carpool with anyone in your area. Instead of taking ownership of drivers, we allow you to take and give rides whenever, providing a channel of communication. This means you don't have to get a new car for some insurance, you pick who you give rides to, and <i>you keep the money</i>.</p>

    <p class="left">FriRide works well for riders too! More drivers can be available since we have fewer restrictions and we don't remove drivers simply for a bad review. Instead, riders can choose a higher rated driver if they wish. You can also post any specifics you'd like to have for the driver to ensure you get the exact type of ride you need. Finally, drivers can charge whatever they want for rides, making it potentially cheaper as well.</p>
